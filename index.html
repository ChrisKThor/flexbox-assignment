    <h2>The point of this was to teach us to use git. I understand it and how it works, but I'm confuse on how to return to specific points. The other side of this assignment was to be nice to our fellow classmates by complimenting them. I understand it and I think its better to just learn git. Also, there is no reason behind this, but the name I used was Sully's, I wasn't paying too much attention to the instructions.</h2>
